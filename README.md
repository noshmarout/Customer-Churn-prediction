This project utilizes 5 merged datasets (Demographics, Transactions, Service, Online, Churn Status). Key Feature Engineering includes RFM metrics, scaling, and encoding. A robust binary classification model is trained, rigorously evaluated via F1-Score and AUC, then saved using joblib for operational deployment.
